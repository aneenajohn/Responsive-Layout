# Responsive Layout

## Day 01: Using percentages & avoiding heights
### Percentages Vs Fixed widths

 By default, things are responsive.

 Unless and until we dont assign a fixed width to any element our website is responsive.
 Whenever we try to create layouts for website, we create a problem by taking the responsiveness away.
 Then, we try to solve this problems by getting into defining media queries for different screen sizes.

### So, how can we fix this problem?
As said earlier, "By default, things are responsive", which means that every element has a width of 100% of its parent.So, irrespective of the screen size, it is always 100% of viewport.
Hence, we can make our life easier and pretty simple by giving width in terms of % values instead of a fixed value.
